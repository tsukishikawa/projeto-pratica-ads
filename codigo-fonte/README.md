# DayPlan - Organize your time

DayPlan is a minimalistic planner for your day to day needs of keeping up with everything going on in your life. This is not, and will never be, an app with a thousand features that you will use for a couple weeks then forget about it. DayPlan offers a straight forward tool for you to prioritize what you need to do and always know what do you need to do NOW.

You can create an account and start using DayPlan alpha version on https://app-prod.d31dr6nrfnggmy.amplifyapp.com/. Please send feedback as issues in this repository.
